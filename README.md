# TensorFlow Model Training and Hyperparameter Optimization

## Overview

This project involves training and optimizing neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras. It covers:

1. **Training a MobileNetV2 Model**: Utilizing a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. **Grid Search Optimization**: Experimenting with various learning rates and epochs.
3. **Batch Size and Optimizer Tuning**: Testing different batch sizes and optimizers.
4. **Random Search Optimization**: Using random search for hyperparameter tuning with TensorBoard integration.

## Features

- **MobileNetV2 Model Training**: Fine-tuning a MobileNetV2 model for image classification on CIFAR-10 dataset.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: Conducting grid search for learning rates, epochs, batch sizes, and optimizers.
- **Visualization**: Using TensorBoard and Matplotlib to visualize training metrics and results.
